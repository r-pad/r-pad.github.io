                   Self-occlusion is challenging for cloth manipulation, as it makes it difficult to estimate the full state of the cloth. Ideally, a robot trying to unfold a crumpled or folded cloth should be able to reason about the cloth's occluded regions.

We leverage recent advances in pose estimation for cloth to build a system that uses explicit occlusion reasoning to unfold a crumpled cloth. Specifically, we first learn a model to reconstruct the mesh of the cloth. However, the model will likely have errors due to the complexities of the cloth configurations and due to ambiguities from occlusions. Our main insight is that we can further refine the predicted reconstruction by performing test-time finetuning with self-supervised losses. The obtained reconstructed mesh allows us to use a mesh-based dynamics model for planning while reasoning about occlusions. We evaluate our system both on cloth flattening as well as on cloth canonicalization, in which the objective is to manipulate the cloth into a canonical pose. Our experiments show that our method significantly outperforms prior methods that do not explicitly account for occlusions or perform test-time optimization.

                    We consider the problem of sequential robotic manipulation of deformable objects using tools.

Previous works have shown that differentiable physics simulators provide gradients to the environment state and help trajectory optimization to converge orders of magnitude faster than model-free reinforcement learning algorithms for deformable object manipulations. However, such gradient-based trajectory optimization typically requires access to the full simulator states and can only solve short-horizon, single-skill tasks due to local optima. In this work, we propose a novel framework, named DiffSkill, that uses a differentiable physics simulator for skill abstraction to solve long-horizon deformable object manipulation tasks from sensory observations. In particular, we first obtain short-horizon skills for using each individual tool from a gradient-based optimizer and then learn a neural skill abstractor from the demonstration videos; Finally, we plan over the skills to solve the long-horizon task. We show the advantages of our method in a new set of sequential deformable object manipulation tasks over previous reinforcement learning algorithms and the trajectory optimizer.

                <blockquote>
                    Liquid state estimation is important for robotics tasks such as pouring; however, estimating the state of transparent liquids is a challenging problem. We propose a novel segmentation pipeline that can segment transparent liquids such as water from a static, RGB image without requiring any manual annotations or heating of the liquid for training. Instead, we use a generative model that is capable of translating images of colored liquids into synthetically generated transparent liquid images, trained only on an unpaired dataset of colored and transparent liquid images. Segmentation labels of colored liquids are obtained automatically using background subtraction. Our experiments show that we are able to accurately predict a segmentation mask for transparent liquids without requiring any manual annotations. We demonstrate the utility of transparent liquid segmentation in a robotic pouring task that controls pouring by perceiving the liquid height in a transparent cup. Accompanying video and supplementary materials can be found on our project page.

                    Real-time object pose estimation is necessary for many robot manipulation algorithms. However, state-of-the-art methods for object pose estimation are trained for a specific set of objects; these methods thus need to be retrained to estimate the pose of each new object, often requiring tens of GPU-days of training for optimal performance. In this paper, we propose the OSSID framework, leveraging a slow zero-shot pose estimator to self-supervise the training of a fast detection algorithm. This fast detector can then be used to filter the input to the pose estimator, drastically improving its inference speed. We show that this self-supervised training exceeds the performance of existing zero-shot detection methods on two widely used object pose estimation and detection datasets, without requiring any human annotations. Further, we show that the resulting method for pose estimation has a significantly faster inference speed, due to the ability to filter out large parts of the image. Thus, our method for self-supervised online learning of a detector (trained using pseudo-labels from a slow pose estimator) leads to accurate pose estimation at real-time speeds, without requiring human annotations.

                     When navigating in urban environments, many of the objects that need to be tracked and avoided are heavily occluded. Planning and tracking using these partial scans can be challenging. The aim of this work is to learn to complete these partial point clouds, giving us a full understanding of the object's geometry using only partial observations. Previous methods achieve this with the help of complete, ground-truth annotations of the target objects, which are available only for simulated datasets. However, such ground truth is unavailable for real-world LiDAR data. In this work, we present a self-supervised point cloud completion algorithm, PointPnCNet, which is trained only on partial scans without assuming access to complete, ground-truth annotations. Our method achieves this via inpainting. We remove a portion of the input data and train the network to complete the missing region. As it is difficult to determine which regions were occluded in the initial cloud and which were synthetically removed, our network learns to complete the full cloud, including the missing regions in the initial partial cloud. We show that our method outperforms previous unsupervised and weakly-supervised methods on both the synthetic dataset, ShapeNet, and real-world LiDAR dataset, Semantic KITTI.

                Benchmarks offer a scientific way to compare algorithms using scientific performance metrics. Good benchmarks have two features: (a) wide audience appeal; (b) easily reproducible. In robotics, there is a tradeoff between reproducibility and broad accessibility. If the benchmark is kept restrictive (fixed hardware, objects), the numbers are reproducible but it becomes niche. On the other hand, benchmark could be just loose set of protocols but the underlying varying setups make it hard to reproduce the results. In this paper, we re-imagine robotics benchmarks – we define a robotics benchmark to be a set of experimental protocols and state of the art algorithmic implementations. These algorithm implementations will provide a way to recreate baseline numbers in a new local robotic setup in less than few hours and hence help provide credible relative rankings between different approaches. These credible local rankings are pooled from several locations to help establish global rankings and SOTA algorithms that work across majority of setups. We introduce RB2 — a benchmark inspired from human SHAP tests. Our benchmark was run across three different labs and reveals several surprising findings.

                3D object detection plays an important role in autonomous driving and other robotics applications. However, these detectors usually require training on large amounts of annotated data that is expensive and time-consuming to collect. Instead, we propose leveraging large amounts of unlabeled point cloud videos by semi-supervised learning of 3D object detectors via temporal graph neural networks. Our insight is that temporal smoothing can create more accurate detection results on unlabeled data, and these smoothed detections can then be used to retrain the detector. We learn to perform this temporal reasoning with a graph neural network, where edges represent the relationship between candidate detections in different time frames.

                Robotic manipulation of cloth remains challenging for robotics due to the complex dynamics of the cloth, lack of a low-dimensional state representation, and self-occlusions. In contrast to previous model-based approaches that learn a pixel-based dynamics model or a compressed latent vector dynamics, we propose to learn a particle-based dynamics model from a partial point cloud observation. To overcome the challenges of partial observability, we infer which visible points are connected on the underlying cloth mesh. We then learn a dynamics model over this visible connectivity graph. Compared to previous learning-based approaches, our model poses strong inductive bias with its particle based representation for learning the underlying cloth physics; it is invariant to visual features; and the predictions can be more easily visualized. We show that our method greatly outperforms previous state-of-the-art model-based and model-free reinforcement learning methods in simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer where we deploy the model trained in simulation on a Franka arm and show that the model can successfully smooth different types of cloth from crumpled configurations. Videos can be found on our project website.

We address the problem of goal-directed cloth manipulation, a challenging task due to the deformability of cloth. Our insight is that optical flow, a technique normally used for motion estimation in video, can also provide an effective representation for corresponding cloth poses across observation and goal images. We introduce FabricFlowNet (FFN), a cloth manipulation policy that leverages flow as both an input and as an action representation to improve performance. FabricFlowNet also elegantly switches between dual-arm and single-arm actions based on the desired goal. We show that FabricFlowNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art model-free and model-based cloth manipulation policies. We also present real-world experiments on a bimanual system, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer. Finally, we show that our method generalizes when trained on a single square cloth to other cloth shapes, such as T-shirts and rectangular cloths.

                Reinforcement learning (RL) in low-data and risk-sensitive domains requires performant and flexible deployment policies that can readily incorporate constraints during deployment. One such class of policies are the semi-parametric H-step lookahead policies, which select actions using trajectory optimization over a dynamics model for a fixed horizon with a terminal value function. In this work, we investigate a novel instantiation of H-step lookahead with a learned model and a terminal value function learned by a model-free off-policy algorithm, named Learning Off-Policy with Online Planning (LOOP). We provide a theoretical analysis of this method, suggesting a tradeoff between model errors and value function errors and empirically demonstrate this tradeoff to be beneficial in deep reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we identify the "Actor Divergence" issue in this framework and propose Actor Regularized Control (ARC), a modified trajectory optimization procedure. We evaluate our method on a set of robotic tasks for Offline and Online RL and demonstrate improved performance. We also show the flexibility of LOOP to incorporate safety constraints during deployment with a set of navigation environments. We demonstrate that LOOP is a desirable framework for robotics applications based on its strong performance in various important RL settings.

                To safely navigate unknown environments, robots must accurately perceive dynamic obstacles. Instead of directly measuring the scene depth with a LiDAR sensor, we explore the use of a much cheaper and higher resolution sensor: <b>programmable light curtains</b>. Light curtains are controllable depth sensors that sense only along a surface that a user selects.  We use light curtains to estimate the <b>safety envelope</b> of a scene: a hypothetical surface that separates the robot from all obstacles. We show that generating light curtains that sense <b>random</b> locations (from a particular distribution) can quickly discover the safety envelope for scenes with unknown objects. Importantly, we produce theoretical safety guarantees on the probability of detecting an obstacle using random curtains. We combine random curtains with a machine learning based model that forecasts and tracks the motion of the safety envelope efficiently. Our method accurately estimates safety envelopes while providing probabilistic safety guarantees that can be used to certify the efficacy of a robot perception system to detect and avoid dynamic obstacles. We evaluate our approach in a simulated urban driving environment and a real-world environment with moving pedestrians using a light curtain device and show that we can estimate safety envelopes efficiently and effectively.

                    Pose estimation is a basic module in many robot manipulation pipelines. Estimating the pose of objects in the environment can be useful for grasping, motion planning, or manipulation. However, current state-of-the-art methods for pose estimation either rely on large annotated training sets or simulated data. Further, the long training times for these methods prohibit quick interaction with novel objects. To address these issues, we introduce a novel method for zero-shot object pose estimation in clutter. Our approach uses a hypothesis generation and scoring framework, with a focus on learning a scoring function that generalizes to objects not used for training. We achieve zero-shot generalization by rating hypotheses as a function of unordered point differences. We evaluate our method on challenging datasets with both textured and untextured objects in cluttered scenes and demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous methods on this task. We also demonstrate how our system can be used by quickly scanning and building a model of a novel object, which can immediately be used by our method for pose estimation. Our work allows users to estimate the pose of novel objects without requiring any retraining.

                Active sensing through the use of Adaptive Depth Sensors is a nascent field, with potential in areas such as Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). They do however require dynamically driving a laser / light-source to a specific location to capture information, with one such class of sensor being the Triangulation Light Curtains (LC). In this work, we introduce a novel approach that exploits prior depth distributions from RGB cameras to drive a Light Curtain's laser line to regions of uncertainty to get new measurements. These measurements are utilized such that depth uncertainty is reduced and errors get corrected recursively. We show real-world experiments that validate our approach in outdoor and driving settings, and demonstrate qualitative and quantitative improvements in depth RMSE when RGB cameras are used in tandem with a Light Curtain.

                Safe local motion planning for autonomous driving in dynamic environments requires forecasting how the scene evolves. Practical autonomy stacks adopt a semantic object-centric representation of a dynamic scene and build object detection, tracking, and prediction modules to solve forecasting. However, training these modules comes at an enormous human cost of manually annotated objects across frames. In this work, we explore future freespace as an alternative representation to support motion planning. Our key intuition is that it is important to avoid straying into occupied space regardless of what is occupying it. Importantly, computing ground-truth future freespace is annotation-free. First, we explore freespace forecasting as a self-supervised learning task. We then demonstrate how to use forecasted freespace to identify collision-prone plans from off-the-shelf motion planners. Finally, we propose future freespace as an additional source of annotation-free supervision. We demonstrate how to integrate such supervision into the learning process of learning-based planners. Experimental results on nuScenes and CARLA suggest both approaches lead to significant reduction in collision rates.

                    Manipulating deformable objects has long been a challenge in robotics due to its high dimensional state representation and complex dynamics. Recent success in deep reinforcement learning provides a promising direction for learning to manipulate deformable objects with data driven methods. However, existing reinforcement learning benchmarks only cover tasks with direct state observability and simple low-dimensional dynamics or with relatively simple image-based environments, such as those with rigid objects. In this paper, we present SoftGym, a set of open-source simulated benchmarks for manipulating deformable objects, with a standard OpenAI Gym API and a Python interface for creating new environments. Our benchmark will enable reproducible research in this important area. Further, we evaluate a variety of algorithms on these tasks and highlight challenges for reinforcement learning algorithms, including dealing with a state representation that has a high intrinsic dimensionality and is partially observable. The experiments and analysis indicate the strengths and limitations of existing methods in the context of deformable object manipulation that can help point the way forward for future methods development. Code and videos of the learned policies can be found on our project website.

                     Current image-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically operate on the whole image without performing object-level reasoning.  This leads to inefficient goal sampling and ineffective reward functions. In this paper, we improve upon previous visual self-supervised RL by incorporating object-level reasoning and occlusion reasoning. Specifically, we use unknown object segmentation to ignore distractors in the scene for better reward computation and goal generation; we further enable occlusion reasoning by employing a novel auxiliary loss and training scheme. We demonstrate that our proposed algorithm,   ROLL (Reinforcement learning with Object Level Learning), learns dramatically faster and achieves better final performance compared with previous methods in several simulated visual control tasks.

<blockquote>
The goal of offline reinforcement learning is to learn a policy from a fixed dataset, without further interactions with the environment. This setting will be an increasingly more important paradigm for real-world applications of reinforcement learning such as robotics, in which data collection is slow and potentially dangerous. Existing off-policy algorithms have limited performance on static datasets due to extrapolation errors from out-of-distribution actions. This leads to the challenge of constraining the policy to select actions within the support of the dataset during training. We propose to simply learn the Policy in the Latent Action Space (PLAS) such that this requirement is naturally satisfied. We evaluate our method on continuous control benchmarks in simulation and a deformable object manipulation task with a physical robot. We demonstrate that our method provides competitive performance consistently across various continuous control tasks and different types of datasets, outperforming existing offline reinforcement learning methods with explicit constraints. </blockquote>

                    Visual data in autonomous driving perception, such as camera image and LiDAR point cloud, can be interpreted as a mixture of two aspects: semantic feature and geometric structure. Semantics come from the appearance and context of objects to the sensor, while geometric structure is the actual 3D shape of point clouds. Most detectors on LiDAR point clouds focus only on analyzing the geometric structure of objects in real 3D space. Unlike previous works, we propose to learn both semantic feature and geometric structure via a unified multi-view framework. Our method exploits the nature of LiDAR scans -- 2D range images, and applies well-studied 2D convolutions to extract semantic features. By fusing semantic and geometric features, our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in all categories by a large margin. The methodology of combining semantic and geometric features provides a unique perspective of looking at the problems in real-world 3D point cloud detection.

                    Most real-world 3D sensors such as LiDARs perform fixed scans of the entire environment, while being decoupled from the recognition system that processes the sensor data. In this work, we propose a method for 3D object recognition using light curtains, a resource-efficient controllable sensor that measures depth at user-specified locations in the environment. Crucially, we propose using prediction uncertainty of a deep learning based 3D point cloud detector to guide active perception. Given a neural network’s uncertainty, we derive an optimization objective to place light curtains using the principle of maximizing information gain. Then, we develop a novel and efficient optimization algorithm to maximize this objective by encoding the physical constraints of the device into a constraint graph and optimizing with dynamic programming. We show how a 3D detector can be trained to detect objects in a scene by sequentially placing uncertainty-guided light curtains to successively improve detection accuracy.

Cloth detection and manipulation is a common task in domestic and industrial settings, yet such tasks remain a challenge for robots due to cloth deformability. Furthermore, in many cloth-related tasks like laundry folding and bed making, it is crucial to manipulate specific regions like edges and corners, as opposed to folds. In this work, we focus on the problem of segmenting and grasping these key regions. Our approach trains a network to segment the edges and corners of a cloth from a depth image, distinguishing such regions from wrinkles or folds. We also provide a novel algorithm for estimating the grasp location, direction, and directional uncertainty from the segmentation. We demonstrate our method on a real robot system and show that it outperforms baseline methods on grasping success.

                    3D object trackers usually require training on large amounts of annotated data that is expensive and time-consuming to collect. Instead, we propose leveraging vast unlabeled datasets by self-supervised metric learning of 3D object trackers, with a focus on data association. Large scale annotations for unlabeled data are cheaply obtained by automatic object detection and association across frames. We show how these self-supervised annotations can be used in a principled manner to learn point-cloud embeddings that are effective for 3D tracking. We estimate and incorporate uncertainty in self-supervised tracking to learn more robust embeddings, without needing any labeled data. We design embeddings to differentiate objects across frames, and learn them using uncertainty-aware self-supervised training. Finally, we demonstrate their ability to perform accurate data association across frames, towards effective and accurate 3D tracking.

                    3D multi-object tracking (MOT) is an essential component for many applications such as autonomous driving and assistive robotics. Recent work on 3D MOT focuses on developing accurate systems giving less attention to practical considerations such as computational cost and system complexity. In contrast, this work proposes a simple real-time 3D MOT system. Our system first obtains 3D detections from a LiDAR point cloud. Then, a straightforward combination of a 3D Kalman filter and the Hungarian algorithm is used for state estimation and data association. Additionally, 3D MOT datasets such as KITTI evaluate MOT methods in the 2D space and standardized 3D MOT evaluation tools are missing for a fair comparison of 3D MOT methods. Therefore, we propose a new 3D MOT evaluation tool along with three new metrics to comprehensively evaluate 3D MOT methods. We show that, although our system employs a combination of classical MOT modules, we achieve state-of-the-art 3D MOT performance on two 3D MOT benchmarks (KITTI and nuScenes). Surprisingly, although our system does not use any 2D data as inputs, we achieve competitive performance on the KITTI 2D MOT leaderboard. Our proposed system runs at a rate of 207.4 FPS on the KITTI dataset, achieving the fastest speed among all modern MOT systems.

                     When interacting with highly dynamic environments, scene flow allows autonomous systems to reason about the non-rigid motion of multiple independent objects. This is of particular interest in the field of autonomous driving, in which many cars, people, bicycles, and other objects need to be accurately tracked. Current state-of-the-art methods require annotated scene flow data from autonomous driving scenes to train scene flow networks with supervised learning. As an alternative, we present a method of training scene flow that uses two self-supervised losses, based on nearest neighbors and cycle consistency. These self-supervised losses allow us to train our method on large unlabeled autonomous driving datasets; the resulting method matches current state-of-the-art supervised performance using no real world annotations and exceeds state-of-the-art performance when combining our self-supervised approach with supervised learning on a smaller labeled dataset.

<blockquote>
State-of-the-art object grasping methods rely on depth sensing to plan robust grasps, but commercially available depth sensors fail to detect transparent and specular objects. To improve grasping performance on such objects, we introduce a method for learning a multi-modal perception model by bootstrapping from an existing uni-modal model. This transfer learning approach requires only a pre-existing uni-modal grasping model and paired multi-modal image data for training, foregoing the need for ground-truth grasp success labels nor real grasp attempts. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach is able to reliably grasp transparent and reflective objects.

                <blockquote>
                    Deep learning object detectors often return false positives with very high confidence. Although they optimize generic detection performance, such as mean average precision (mAP), they are not designed for reliability. For a reliable detection system, if a high confidence detection is made, we would want high certainty that the object has indeed been detected. To achieve this, we have developed a set of verification tests which a proposed detection must pass to be accepted. We develop a theoretical framework which proves that, under certain assumptions, our verification tests will not accept any false positives. Based on an approximation to this framework, we present a practical detection system that can verify, with high precision, whether each detection of a machine-learning based object detector is correct. We show that these tests can improve the overall accuracy of a base detector and that accepted examples are highly likely to be correct. This allows the detector to operate in a high precision regime and can thus be used for robotic perception systems as a reliable instance detection method.

                        Although object tracking has been studied for decades, real-time tracking algorithms often suffer from low accuracy and poor robustness when confronted with difficult, real-world data. We present a tracker that combines 3D shape, color (when available), and motion cues to accurately track moving objects in real-time. Our tracker allocates computational effort based on the shape of the posterior distribution. Starting with a coarse approximation to the posterior, the tracker successively refines this distribution, increasing in tracking accuracy over time. The tracker can thus be run for any amount of time, after which the current approximation to the posterior is returned. Even at a minimum runtime of 0.7 milliseconds, our method outperforms all of the baseline methods of similar speed by at least 10%. If our tracker is allowed to run for longer, the accuracy continues to improve, and it continues to outperform all baseline methods. Our tracker is thus anytime, allowing the speed or accuracy to be optimized based on the needs of the application.

                        Precision tracking is important for predicting the
                        behavior of other cars in autonomous driving. We present a
                        novel method to combine laser and camera data to achieve
                        accurate velocity estimates of moving vehicles. We combine
                        sparse laser points with a high-resolution camera image to
                        obtain a dense colored point cloud. We use a color-augmented
                        search algorithm to align the dense color point clouds from
                        successive time frames for a moving vehicle, thereby obtaining
                        a precise estimate of the tracked vehicle’s velocity. Using this
                        alignment method, we obtain velocity estimates at a much
                        higher accuracy than previous methods. Through pre-ﬁltering,
                        we are able to achieve near real time results. We also present an
                        online method for real-time use with accuracies close to that of
                        the full method. We present a novel approach to quantitatively
                        evaluate our velocity estimates by tracking a parked car in
                        a local reference frame in which it appears to be moving
                        relative to the ego vehicle. We use this evaluation method to
                        automatically quantitatively evaluate our tracking performance
                        on 466 separate tracked vehicles. Our method obtains a mean
                        absolute velocity error of 0.27 m/s and an RMS error of 0.47
                        m/s on this test set. We can also qualitatively evaluate our
                        method by building color 3D car models from moving vehicles.
                        We have thus demonstrated that our method can be used for
                        precision car tracking with applications to autonomous driving
                        and behavior modeling.

                        Detecting cars in real-world images is an important task for autonomous driving, yet it remains unsolved. The system described in this paper takes advantage of context and scale to build a monocular single-frame image-based car detector that significantly outperforms the baseline. The system uses a probabilistic model to combine multiple forms of evidence for both context and scale to locate cars in a real-world image. We also use scale filtering to speed up our algorithm by a factor of 3.3 compared to the baseline. By using a calibrated camera and localization on a road map, we are able to obtain context and scale information from a single image without the use of a 3D laser. The system outperforms the baseline by an absolute 9.4% in overall average precision and 11.7% in average precision for cars smaller than 50 pixels in height, for which context and scale cues are especially important.

                        A number of robotic studies have recently turned to biological inspiration in designing control schemes for flexible robots. Examples of such robots include continuous manipulators inspired by the octopus arm. However, the control strategies used by an octopus in moving its arms are still not fully understood. Starting from a dynamic model of an octopus arm and a given set of muscle activations, we develop a simulation technique to characterize the stiffness throughout a motion and at multiple points along the arm. By applying this technique to reaching and bending motions, we gain a number of insights that can help a control engineer design a biologically inspired impedance control scheme for a flexible robot arm. The framework developed is a general one that can be applied to any motion for any dynamic model. We also propose a theoretical analysis to efficiently estimate the stiffness analytically given a set of muscle activations. This analysis can be used to quickly evaluate the stiffness for new static configurations and dynamic movements.

                        In order to achieve autonomous operation of a vehicle in urban situations with unpredictable traffic, several realtime systems must interoperate, including environment perception, localization, planning, and control. In addition, a robust vehicle platform with appropriate sensors, computational hardware, networking, and software infrastructure is essential. We previously published an overview of Junior, Stanford's entry in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge. This race was a closed-course competition which, while historic and inciting much progress in the field, was not fully representative of the situations that exist in the real world. In this paper, we present a summary of our recent research towards the goal of enabling safe and robust autonomous operation in more realistic situations. First, a trio of unsupervised algorithms automatically calibrates our 64-beam rotating LIDAR with accuracy superior to tedious hand measurements. We then generate high-resolution maps of the environment which are subsequently used for online localization with centimeter accuracy. Improved perception and recognition algorithms now enable Junior to track and classify obstacles as cyclists, pedestrians, and vehicles; traffic lights are detected as well. A new planning system uses this incoming data to generate thousands of candidate trajectories per second, choosing the optimal path dynamically. The improved controller continuously selects throttle, brake, and steering actuations that maximize comfort and minimize trajectory error. All of these algorithms work in sun or rain and during the day or night. With these systems operating together, Junior has successfully logged hundreds of miles of autonomous operation in a variety of real-life conditions.

                        The Caltech Multi-Vehicle Wireless Testbed is an experimental platform for validating theoretical advances in multiple-vehicle coordination and cooperation, real-time networked control system, and distributed computation. This paper describes the design and development of an additional fleet of 12 second-generation vehicles. These vehicles are hovercrafts and designed to have lower mass and friction as well as smaller size than the first generation vehicles. These hovercrafts combined with the outdoor wireless testbed provide a perfect hardware platform for RoboFlag competition.

                        The locus of vibrotactile stimulation is often used as an encoding cue in tactile displays developed for spatial orientation and navigation. However, the ability to localize the site of stimulation varies as a function of the number and configuration of the vibrating motors (tactors) in the display. As the inter-tactor distance decreases it has been found that the ability to localize a point of stimulation diminishes. One factor that may limit tactile localization is the surface wave elicited by vibration that propagates across the skin at a velocity that depends on the frequency of vibration and the viscoelastic properties of the skin. A material that simulates the stress-strain characteristics of human skin was used to measure the characteristics of surface waves during vibrotactile stimulation. Accelerometers glued to the simulated skin at fixed distances from the activated tactors were used to measure the amplitude of the acceleration as a function of distance as well as the propagation velocity. It was determined that at a distance of 60 mm from the site of activation, the surface wave was on average attenuated to less than 1 m/s^2. This suggests that for this type of tactor an inter-tactor distance of at least 60 mm would be optimal for a display in which the locus of stimulation is used as an encoding variable. It seems that much of the difficulty encountered in identifying the locus of a vibrotactile stimulus in multi-tactor displays may result from small intertactor distances.

                        A series of experiments was conducted to evaluate the operating characteristics of small DC motors that are often in tactile displays. The results indicated that these motors are reliable in terms of their frequency and amplitude of oscillation, but that the frequency varies across motors. A simulated skin material was developed to provide a substrate for evaluating the performance of the motors. There was a marked attenuation in frequency when the tactors were on this material and the surface waves could be detected 60 mm from the site of activation. These findings suggest that the spacing between tactors should be at least 60-80 mm if tactile cues are used to locate events in the environment.

            I gave a talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDXZXljc2Ic">"Demystifying the Post-doc - Why, Where, and How?"</a>  If you are considering doing a post-doc, the advice in this talk might be helpful.

            In this talk, I describe the ins and outs of getting a job as a post-doctoral researcher ("doing a post-doc").  I first describe a number of reasons why one might want to do a post-doc, as well as a few reasons not to do one.  I next describe how to choose where one should apply for a post-doc.  Next, I describe the process of how to get a job in a dream post-doc position.  I also describe how to choose among multiple post-doc offers.  Last, I will describe how to be "successful" as a post-doc, i.e. how to make the most of your time as a post-doc and prepare for your future career.  You can watch this video
